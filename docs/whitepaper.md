## üß≠ Executive Summary

**WahkoLab** is an open-source game development platform and decentralized incubator.

- Contributors collaborate on games without upfront pay  
- Each project mints its own token to track contributions  
- Tokens grant governance rights and future revenue share  
- WahkoLab acts as publisher when the community votes to release the game  
- Revenues are distributed to token holders  
- WahkoLab keeps a small % (5‚Äì10%) to sustain the platform

We‚Äôre building a system where game developers are co-owners ‚Äî not employees.

---

## ‚ùå The Problem

- Game developers are underpaid; studios and publishers keep the profits  
- Open source game dev lacks structure, governance, and reward systems  
- Creative contributions are rarely monetized fairly post-launch

---

## üåç The Vision

**Mission**: Build a fair, decentralized platform for game creation and monetization.

**Core Values**  
- Open collaboration  
- Transparent governance  
- Token-based contribution rewards  
- Community empowerment

**Inspiration**: DAOs, GitHub, Godot, Gitcoin, Mirror

## üéÆ Project Lifecycle

1. üí° Project created and approved  
2. üß† Team assembled via Discord + GitHub  
3. üìã Tasks proposed, scoped, and claimed  
4. üë®‚Äçüíª Contributions made and submitted (code, art, docs‚Ä¶)  
5. ‚úÖ Peer review and validation  
6. üîÅ Tokens issued to contributors  
7. üöÄ Game published when community votes  
8. üí∏ Revenue split via smart contract

## ü™ô Project Tokens

Each project mints its own token (e.g. `$PAPER`):

**Used for**  
- Contribution tracking  
- Governance votes  
- Revenue distribution

**Token rules**  
- Tokens are earned, not bought  
- Allocation is based on validated contributions  
- Reputation > speculation  
- Initially non-transferable (optionally upgradable)

---

## üó≥Ô∏è Governance

Each project is a **mini DAO**:

- Token-weighted voting  
- Contributors can propose features, hires, budgets  
- Governance tooling is shared but customizable

**Examples of votes**  
- Accepting new members  
- Starting alpha/beta  
- Budgeting paid bounties  
- Triggering commercial launch

---

## üèóÔ∏è WahkoLab‚Äôs Role

WahkoLab provides the shared infrastructure for all project DAOs:

- Collaborative tooling (Discord, bots, repo templates)  
- Smart contract deployment (tokens, vaults, votes)  
- Publishing & platform listings (Steam, Itch, App Store‚Ä¶)  
- Legal wrapper (optional)  
- Platform maintenance (funded via revenue %)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Stack

- Ethereum L2 blockchain (Arbitrum, Base, Polygon)  
- Smart contracts for token, voting, and distribution  
- GitHub integration for contribution flow  
- Game engine support (Godot preferred, Unity/Unreal optional)  
- WahkoID = wallet + reputation + task history

---

## üìÜ Roadmap

**Q1‚ÄìQ2 (Pre-MVP)**  
- Website + branding  
- Community launch (Discord, GitHub)  
- Contributor onboarding

**Q3‚ÄìQ4 (MVP)**  
- 2‚Äì3 project DAOs launched on testnet  
- Token allocation logic live  
- Governance via Discord/Snapshot

**Year 2+**  
- First commercial releases  
- Mainnet deployment  
- WahkoLab Creator Fund (optional)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Conclusion

**Risks**  
- Legal uncertainty (tokens, licensing)  
- Upfront unpaid work may limit adoption  
- DAO governance can stall  
- IP or reward abuse possible

**Conclusion**  
WahkoLab empowers creators to build, earn, and own ‚Äî together.
