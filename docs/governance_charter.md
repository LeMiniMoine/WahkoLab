# ⚖️ WahkoLab Project Governance Charter (Template)

## Purpose

To establish fair and transparent decision-making mechanisms for each independent WahkoLab game project.

---

## Core Roles

- **Contributors**: Anyone proposing and completing features, code, design, etc.
- **Reviewers**: Token holders or trusted members with rights to validate contributions.
- **Core Maintainers**: Delegated or elected members with permission to merge PRs and moderate discussions.

---

## Governance Parameters

- **Voting Method**: Defined per project – e.g., simple majority, token-weighted, delegated.
- **Proposal Threshold**: A contributor must hold at least 1% of project tokens to initiate a vote.
- **Quorum Requirement**: A minimum of 20% token participation is required for a vote to be valid.

---

## Token Allocation

- Tokens are granted only upon acceptance of contributions.
- Each accepted Pull Request (PR), design asset, or documented task leads to token issuance.
- Value of each contribution is predefined or voted post-acceptance.

---

## Dispute Resolution

- Initial disputes are handled internally by Core Maintainers.
- Unresolved issues may be escalated to WahkoLab Global Governance (arbitration panel).
- All decisions are recorded on-chain and publicly viewable.

---

## Customization

Each project DAO may extend or amend this charter with:

- Role definitions
- Governance parameters
- Token utility and lock-up rules

---

This charter ensures that contributions are respected, validated through community trust, and rewarded fairly according to open and consistent standards.
