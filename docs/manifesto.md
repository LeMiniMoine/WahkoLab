# 📜 WahkoLab Founding Manifesto

> *We believe game development should be a creative and equitable act of community — not an extractive system driven by publishers.*

**WahkoLab** is a movement. A statement. A working alternative to the current gaming industry.  
We build open-source games governed by contributors, not shareholders.  
We share ownership, rewards, and decisions — together.

## 🌍 What We Stand For

### 1. Decentralized Collaboration  
Games are made by teams, not corporations. WahkoLab enables fair, transparent, and async teamwork — open to anyone with talent and commitment.

### 2. Open Source by Default  
All projects are built in the open. Code, assets, and ideas are made to be remixable, forkable, and improved over time.

### 3. Contributions That Count  
Whether you write code, craft a sprite, design a level, or write lore — every task is logged, validated, and rewarded transparently.

### 4. Ownership Through Effort  
No upfront pay. No speculation. Tokens are earned by doing — they represent your share of the project and your right to shape its future.

### 5. Sustainable Creativity  
WahkoLab encourages long-term thinking: build games that last, grow communities that evolve, and earn only when real value is created.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

The traditional model extracts value from creators while rewarding intermediaries.  
We believe the opposite should be true: those who *build* should *own*.

By merging open-source principles with Web3 tools, WahkoLab creates a new creative economy:

- No gatekeepers  
- No crunch-for-nothing  
- No invisible contributors  

Only shared goals, visible contributions, and equitable rewards.

*Not for publishers. Not for platforms.*  
**For creators — by creators.**

**Welcome to WahkoLab.**
