# 📋 WahkoLab Task Governance Model

To prevent abuse and ensure quality, WahkoLab enforces a structured task lifecycle and role-based validation process.

---

## 🛠️ Task Lifecycle

```
[Proposed] ➝ [Validated] ➝ [Executed] ➝ [Reviewed] ➝ [Rewarded]
```

---

## 👤 Who Can Create Tasks?

| Role                 | Can Create Tasks |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Game Designer        | ✅ (Gameplay, mechanics, features) |
| Lead Developer/Core  | ✅ (Technical tasks, bugs, tools) |
| Contributors         | ⚠️ Must submit proposals for approval |
| DAO Token Holders    | ✅ If threshold/quorum is met |

➡️ Tasks proposed by non-core contributors must be approved before activation.

---

## ✅ Task Validation Rules

### Small Tasks (≤ 50 tokens)
- Validated by 1 reviewer (lead or trusted role)
- OR auto-approved if pulled from a pre-approved backlog

### Medium Tasks (50–200 tokens)
- Requires 2 reviewers or simplified DAO vote
- Often pre-approved in sprint planning

### Large Tasks (> 200 tokens)
- Requires DAO vote or top token holder approval
- Typically pre-discussed in governance forum or Discord

---

## ✔️ Validation Criteria

Each task must:
- Be clearly written (goal + deliverables + constraints)
- Have an estimated token value
- Specify required role/skill to complete
- Fit within the roadmap or sprint plan

---

## 🔒 Anti-Abuse Mechanisms

| Abuse Scenario              | Preventive Rule                       |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Spam / low-value tasks      | Require validation for tasks > 20 tokens |
| Self-creation + execution   | Creator ≠ executor policy enforced     |
| Token farming via volume    | Daily cap per user / per role          |
| Unjustified tasks           | Must link to roadmap or active sprint  |

---

## 🧠 Reputation Incentives (Future)

- Task creators may gain score if their tasks are completed successfully
- Abusive patterns may reduce trust or trigger cooldowns
- A public “Creator Score” can track reliability over time

This system balances **open contribution** with **project integrity** — helping WahkoLab scale without losing trust or quality.
