# 🔁 WahkoLab Contribution Flow – From Idea to Reward

This guide explains how contribution, validation, and token-based rewards work in WahkoLab.

---

## 🌟 Step-by-Step

1. **💡 Idea Submission**  
   Post an idea or task in Discord (`#project-ideas`) or directly on GitHub.

2. **🧩 Task Assignment**  
   Define scope and value (in tokens).  
   Anyone can apply to take the task.

3. **🛠️ Work In Progress**  
   Contribute code, design, assets, docs, etc.  
   Use GitHub to manage your fork or branch.

4. **📤 Pull Request / Submission**  
   Open a PR to the project repo or submit to project lead.

5. **🔍 Peer Review / Vote**  
   Review by maintainers or vote by token holders.  
   Task gets approved or sent back for revision.

6. **✅ Merge & Token Allocation**  
   Once approved and merged, tokens are issued to the contributor.

7. **📊 On-Chain Record**  
   Contribution + tokens received logged in the public ledger.

8. **🗳️ Governance Power**  
   Contributors use tokens to vote on project decisions.

## 🔐 Governance Safeguards

- Tokens are only distributed if work is validated  
- Large tasks may require multi-review or quorum votes  
- Contribution ledgers are open and auditable
