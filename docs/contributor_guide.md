# 🧑‍💻 WahkoLab Contributor Guide

Welcome to **WahkoLab** 👾  
An open-source platform where game creators earn reputation and future revenue through validated contributions.

---

## 🚀 How to Contribute

1. Join our Discord and visit `#contributor-hub`
2. Check out `#project-ideas` or an active project category
3. Introduce yourself in that project's `#recruitment` channel
4. Propose a task (feature, bug fix, artwork, etc.)
5. Fork the repository or join the project repo
6. Work on your contribution and submit a Pull Request (PR)
7. Get reviewed by core members or token holders
8. Upon approval, you receive project tokens as your reward

---

## 🧾 Good Practices

- Follow each project’s `CONTRIBUTING.md` and roadmap
- Communicate clearly and respectfully
- Keep your PRs well-described and scoped
- Ask for feedback if your PR is not accepted

---

## 💡 Key Concepts

- **You earn tokens, not salaries** → value is attributed post-launch  
- **Tokens = Reputation** → more tokens = more governance power  
- **Open review model** → your work is peer-reviewed before rewards  
- **No approval = no tokens** → validation is required to earn

## 🆘 Where to Get Help

- `#faq` – for common questions
- `#governance-votes` – to propose or discuss rules
- Ping any team with `@Contributor` if you’re lost!

Let’s build the next great game — together.
