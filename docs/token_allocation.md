# ðŸª™ WahkoLab Token Allocation Model

This model ensures fair and transparent distribution of project tokens based on contribution value, role, effort, and seniority.

---

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### 1. Base Scoring by Role

Each contribution is evaluated with a weighted score based on:

- **60% Workload** (measured in person-days)
- **40% Required Seniority** (scored from 0 = junior to 5 = lead)

This score helps determine how many tokens are allocated to each role.

---

### 2. Global Project Distribution

For a standard project (e.g., 10,000 tokens budget), distribution is proportional to each roleâ€™s total contribution score.

Roles with higher effort and complexity earn more tokens, but distribution scales with actual validated participation.

---

## ðŸ§© Per-Task Token Flow

Each task has its own mini-token economy:

- **15%** goes to the person who **created** the task (designer, lead, etc.)
- **75%** goes to the person who **executes** the task (coder, artist, etc.)
- **10%** goes to the person(s) who **validate** the task (maintainer, DAO vote, peer review)

---

## ðŸ§  Governance Safeguards

- All token distributions are tied to validated contributions
- Task creators â‰  executors (separation of concerns)
- Token abuse is prevented through role thresholds and validation layers

---

## ðŸ“Š Example Scenario

A developer completes a mid-complexity task worth 100 tokens:

- 15 tokens to the task creator (e.g., Game Designer)
- 75 tokens to the developer who did the work
- 10 tokens to the lead or reviewer who approved it

---

This model can evolve over time but provides a solid and transparent base to ensure contributors are rewarded based on **impact and validation**, not status or speculation.
